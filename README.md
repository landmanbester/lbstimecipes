# lbstimecipes
A collection of unsorted stimela cabs and recipes. Use at your own peril!
Most dependencies have stable releases and should be pip installable (eg. tricolour, crystalball and breizorro).
Some cabs still depend on experimental python packages viz.

* https://github.com/ratt-ru/pfb-clean.git
* https://github.com/landmanbester/lbscratch.git
* https://github.com/ratt-ru/surfvis.git  (use the sspectrum branch)

which have to be installed manually.
